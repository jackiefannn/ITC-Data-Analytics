# ITC-Data-Analytics

Extracted data on roads and paving schedule in the City of Pittsburgh for analysis. After grabbing this data, we performed testing on multiple target variables to try and determine what features cause the highest accidents on roads. Using this information, we formulated a proposal to determine which streets to prioritize paving on.
